Native 180°/360° video player for a PlayStation VR2 connected to a Mac
(Apple Silicon) through Sony's official PC adapter (CFI-ZAA1). No kexts, no
Sony software: macOS sees the headset as a regular 4000×2040@120 display,
and head pose is read over USB via libusb.

Tested on: MacBook Air M4, macOS 15+, PSVR2 + PC adapter (DP cable + USB).

The adapter is mandatory. Plugging the headset cable straight into a Mac
Thunderbolt port doesn't even power it up (no standby LED, nothing appears
on USB). The headset's USB-C plug follows the VirtualLink spec — its own
pin-out and 12 V power delivery, distinct from regular USB-C PD / DP Alt
Mode — which a Thunderbolt port doesn't speak. The adapter (with its power
brick) bridges that gap. No software can work around it.

## Features

- Side-by-side stereo rendering with lens-distortion and chromatic-aberration
  correction using the factory calibration of your specific headset (protocol
  from the [Monado](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado) driver,
  BSL-1.0)
- Head tracking: the headset's on-board SLAM (~60 Hz) plus IMU integration
  (2000 Hz) with extrapolation — honest 120 fps with no ghosting
- Per-scanline rolling-shutter compensation driven by the gyro
- Projections: equirect 360°, half-equirect 180°, fisheye (adjustable FOV);
  SBS / top-bottom / mono stereo; auto-detected from the file name
- Hardware video decoding (AVFoundation) — 8K HEVC is not a problem;
  playback speed 0.5–2× with pitch-corrected audio
- Audio routes to the headset's headphones automatically. Recenter with the
  Fn button — the small button on the underside of the visor, bottom right
  when the headset is on your head
- Control panel and file picker rendered inside the headset (appears on
  mouse move, anchored in space); timeline with click and drag seeking.
  The system cursor stays hidden over video when the panel fades out;
  moving the mouse brings the panel and its virtual cursor back.
- File list with thumbnails, duration and resolution; the player remembers
  where you stopped in every file and resumes from there
- A "Format" submenu for explicit projection / stereo layout / speed /
  fisheye-FOV selection
- Stop button closes the file and returns to the picker; when no file is
  open the picker stays on screen, floating in a black space environment
  with a nebula and stars (procedurally generated, pure-black background —
  OLED-friendly; regenerate your own with `tools/nebula.swift`)
- Proximity-sensor integration: video auto-pauses when you take the headset
  off and resumes when you put it back on; the mouse is captured only while
  the headset is worn — take it off and your Mac is usable as usual, no
  alt-tabbing; on the first wear after launch the scene and panel recenter
  to your gaze
- Passthrough: view from the headset's front cameras (double-press Fn
  or `B`) to look around without removing the headset; video pauses and the
  player UI hides. The cameras sit wider than your eyes, so converge the
  images with `,`/`.`; `M` toggles stereo/mono, `+`/`-` sets the lens angle
- A remote/status window on the monitor: shows current state and hotkeys,
  keeps keyboard focus so macOS permission prompts never open invisibly on
  the headset display; its close button quits the player. If a permission
  dialog does appear, the headset shows a hint and releases the mouse so you
  can click it. Stray windows that land on the headset display are moved
  back to the monitor automatically (needs the Accessibility permission,
  otherwise the player warns you)

## Building

```sh
brew install libusb
cd player && make      # builds PSVR2Player.app
```

## Running

```sh
player/play        # or ./play from the player/ directory
```

This is the normal way to use the player: it starts with the file picker
right in the headset — browse folders (thumbnails, durations, resume
positions) and click a video with the virtual cursor. You can also launch
`player/PSVR2Player.app` from Finder/Dock instead.

Click **Shuffle** in the file picker's bottom row to randomize the videos in
the current folder. Folders stay at the top. Click again for a new order;
the order is remembered when you return to that folder during the same app session.

To open a specific file right away, pass it as an argument:

```sh
player/play "video_180_SBS.mp4"
```

`play` keeps the log in your terminal; when launched from Finder/Dock the
log goes to `~/Library/Logs/PSVR2Player.log` (watch with `tail -f` or
Console.app).

For stuttering, compare `[stat] fps` (headset redraws) with `[playback]
videoFPS` (distinct video frames delivered). A 60 fps video should deliver
about 60 new frames per second during steady playback at 1×, even though
the headset redraws at 120 Hz. `maxGap` records the longest interval without
a new frame while playing; `copyMax` measures the longest video-output fetch.
Seek requests and completion times are logged separately. Pausing, starting,
and seeking can lower the counts in the surrounding two-second report.

Files on mounted network volumes automatically use a 256 MiB RAM cache of
compressed data. A background reader fetches 2 MiB chunks and reads ahead;
AVFoundation receives byte ranges through a custom resource loader. The
original file stays on the NAS, with no remuxing, transcoding, or disk copy.
The cache is released when the file closes. Local files use the normal path.

Only one decoder seek runs at a time; rapid inputs replace the queued target.
Seeking prioritizes the new requests and stops scheduling old read-ahead.
An SMB read already in progress must finish before the next one starts.
The headset shows "Buffering from NAS…" when video delivery waits, and the
remote window also reports buffering. A seek can still pause briefly while
the decoder restarts. `[nas]` logs show cache usage, active read speed, longest
read, and cache hits/misses. The read speed includes OS-cached reads and is
not a measurement of physical network throughput. The RAM limit applies to
the app's compressed-data cache; AVFoundation and rendering use extra memory.

Run `tools/test-nas-buffer` for resource-loader regression checks. It requires
ffmpeg and generates a temporary test video, compares compressed video/audio
samples against direct file reading, and checks rapid seeks, pause during a
seek, EOF, errors, and cleanup. For troubleshooting NAS-specific behavior,
compare the original file with a local copy.

In macOS Settings, set the "PS VR2" display to 120 Hz.

Keys: `Space` pause · `R`/Fn button on the headset — recenter (long-press Fn
centers the video on your gaze, handy when lying down; double-press — camera
view) · `B` camera view (`M` stereo/mono, `,`/`.` convergence) ·
`F` projection · `G` stereo · `V` vertical flip · `,`/`.` stereo depth (pushes
an uncomfortably close scene away; separate from camera convergence) ·
`←/→` ±15 s · `↑/↓` volume ·
`+/-` fisheye FOV or camera lens angle · `Q` quit.
Mouse: move — panel · click — select · right-drag — tilt scene ·
wheel — scroll list. Trackpad: two-finger scroll — list, two-finger
press-drag — tilt scene.
Debug: `P` pose prediction · `[`/`]` look-ahead · `S` scanline correction ·
`C` chromatic correction · `D` vsync.

## Layout

- `player/` — the player itself: `main.swift` (AppKit + Metal +
  AVFoundation + the shader), `overlay.swift` (in-headset panel and file
  picker), `nas.swift` (network-file read-ahead), `seeking.swift` (queued seeks),
  `meta.swift` (thumbnail/metadata cache), `sweeper.swift` (moves stray windows
  off the headset display), `passthrough.swift` (camera frames
  to BC4 textures), `cpsvr2.c` (SLAM/IMU/status/camera streams over libusb),
  `lut.c` (distortion table from Monado), `environment.jpg` (the space
  panorama shown when nothing is playing)
- `tools/nebula.swift` — generator of the space environment
  (`swift -O tools/nebula.swift 8192 player/environment.jpg <variant>`)
- `tools/fix-hev1`, `tools/tag-hvc1` — fix HEVC files tagged `hev1`, which
  AVFoundation refuses to decode: `tag-hvc1` retags the 4 bytes in place when
  the codec parameters are already in the track header; `fix-hev1` remuxes
  via ffmpeg when they are not
- `tools/psvr2_probe.c` — USB protocol diagnostics

## What else the headset can do (exploration)

Through the PC adapter the headset exposes more than the player uses.
Recon tools (`tools/`, require the player to be closed — the interfaces are
claimed exclusively):

- `psvr2_scan` — map of all USB interfaces and endpoints with live
  sniffing; shows where active streams exist
- `psvr2_gaze` — eye tracking: the `GS` stream (interface 5, EP 0x85) is
  enabled by vendor command `0x0C`. **Works**: packets flow and the
  structure matches byte for byte (0x148). But the validity fields stay
  zero — a per-user calibration blob is needed (that part of PSVR2Toolkit
  is closed)
- `psvr2_camera` — passthrough (already built into the player). The cameras
  are enabled by vendor command `0x0B` (payload `01 00 00 00 10 00 00 00`),
  frames arrive on interface 6, EP 0x87 with a `VI` signature: a 256-byte
  header plus two 1024×1016 BC4 textures (left and right cameras, 8-bit
  grayscale, wide angle). Important: send the command **after** claiming
  the interface, otherwise the stream stays silent

Also visible in the streams: `LD` (interface 8) — 508×508 eye cameras,
60 Hz; `ST` (interface 11) — ~23 MB/s of SLAM telemetry; `RP` (interface
9) — periodic ~800 KB dumps.
